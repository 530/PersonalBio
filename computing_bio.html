  <h1>Computer Biography</h1>
	<h4>Current Job Title: Junior Network Administrator</h4>
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremiah-howell-52387b90/" id="color" class="font">LinkedIn</a>
	<p>I grew up around computers, my dad is a Senior Network Engineer so computers and anything tech related was 
			easily available to me. As well as if I had any questions.</br>
	</p>
	<h3>Motivation for taking this course:</h3>
	<p>I took this course becuase it is required, as well as I find web programming a lot more fun than the other languages
		 out there, such as what is mainly taught at Chico State, C++.. It is also a lot easier to interact with and has a lot faster
		 results than most languages.
