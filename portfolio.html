		<h2>Below are a couple of my repositories for my favorite assignments</h2>
		<a href="https://github.com/530/Alan-Turing" id="color" class="font"> Alan Turing</a></br>
		<p> This assignment was the very first one, in which each group was assigned a computer
		scientist. Mine ended up being someone I had actually just learned about last semester from
		a friend of mine. Alan Turing was one of the greatest computer scientists to have walked the 
		Earth in my opinion. This assignment was a very basic introduction on putting together html. 
		In a later Repo, we add style tags to it, to make it look a little more clean.</p>
		<a href="https://github.com/530/MovieSpoiler" id="color" class="font"> Movie Spoiler</a></br>
		<p> This assignment introduced the hover pseudo class and how we could block text until it was
		highlighted over. I thought this was a cool assignment, due to the fact of the hidden text.</p>
		<a href="https://github.com/530/MySchedule" id="color" class="font"> My Schedule</a></br>
		<p> This assignment covered the use of tables, as well as incorporating the use of hover and different
		ways to style a table. I spent a little more time on this assignment because it really interested me. I
		liked the way I was able to make the boarders for it and clean it up. I incorporated some of that assignment
		into my navigation bar on this project.</p>
